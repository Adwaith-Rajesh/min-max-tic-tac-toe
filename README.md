## Tic Tac Toe w/ Min Max

A simple Tic Tac Toe 'AI' using min max algorithm. The min max used here is the most
simplified version of min max you can get.

No depth value or anything fancy. It works.

## Try it....

#### Install the dependencies

```commandline
pip3 install flet
```

#### Clone the repo

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/min-max-tic-tac-toe.git
```

#### Run the file

```commandline
python3 ui.py
```

> It will take some time for the first move to compute. Things are a bit slow.

## TODO's

- [] Make it faster.
  - use Alpha Beta Pruning
  - write the algo as a c extension (why not)
- [] Allow the player to choose sides

#### That's It. Bye.....
